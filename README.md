### About the Project
Welcome to Rancid Tomatillos!

    In this application, we were assigned to build an IMDB style application to display a 
list of movies from an API given to us by Turing instructors. We were given a week and 
a half to complete the website in React using Router, and testing with cypress, all new 
tools for us that we were to learn for this project.

    We were tasked with building a main page displaying all the movies as simplified cards,
a details page where we display in depth information on a movie as chosen by the user. 
we then were tasked with furthering our learning goals with some extensions, which we decided to embed trailers into our movie details page and extend our cypress testing to be more comprehensive.

## Set Up

1. Start by cloning down this repo to your local machine and cd into the directory.
2. Once inside the directory run npm install. 
3. Run npm start and you will see a message displaying the localhost port the app is running on. If it does not automatically open in the browser, navigate to the localhost address provided in your terminal.


## Application in Action

Upon loading the application, you will see a page displaying all of the avalable movies.
You can click on a movie's card to view its information, and even watch a trailer 
for that movie. If you click on the header, it will take you to the main page again.

## Organizational Resources

This project utlizes a simple and concise [figjam board](https://www.figma.com/file/YqhwZlTqNIZbO8a4peaPmg/Rancid-Tomatillos?node-id=0%3A1) to create an intial project board during the planning phase that was transfered over to [GitHubs project board](https://github.com/kendallm360/rotten-tomatillos/projects/1).  

The team then used figma to design a [wireframe](https://www.figma.com/file/6UkVkrxyQVjI2115GzNDyl/Rotten-tomatillos-2?node-id=0%3A1) for all of our different dashboard views. 

## Cypress Testing

We tested our application with Cypress for full E2E testing. To set up Cypress:

1. Cd into the rancid-tomatillos directory.
2. Run npm install -D cypress.
